# Bike Purchase Analysis Project

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction  
This project explores the purchasing behavior of 1,000 individuals regarding bike purchases using demographic data. The aim is to help a fictional bike company understand what factors influence customer purchases, so they can improve marketing and sales strategies. The dataset includes details like marital status, gender, education level, region, age group, number of cars, homeownership, occupation, and number of children.

## ðŸ§¹ Data Cleaning / Preparation  
The dataset was relatively clean but went through the following steps before analysis:
- Verified that all column headers were properly named.
- Checked for and confirmed absence of missing or null values.
- Created an **Age Group** column (Adult or Old) to better categorize age.
- Converted categorical fields where necessary for consistency in Power BI visuals.
- Removed unnecessary formatting that could interfere with dashboard visuals.

## ðŸ“Š Analysis / Visuals  
The dashboard was built using Microsoft Power BI and contains the following visual insights:

- **Bike Purchase by Marital Status & Gender**:  
  Highlights differences in purchase behavior between married and single individuals, further segmented by gender.

- **Bike Purchase by Education Level & Gender**:  
  Shows that higher education levels correlate with increased bike purchases, especially among professionals.

- **Bike Purchase by Occupation & Marital Status**:  
  Indicates that professionals and skilled manual workers are more likely to purchase bikes, especially if married.

- **Bike Purchase by Region**:  
  Reveals that most purchases come from **North America**, followed by **Europe** and **Pacific** regions.

- **Bike Purchase by Age Group**:  
  Shows comparison between adults and older individuals in purchasing behavior.

- **Bike Purchase by Home Ownership**:  
  Displays the tendency of homeowners to purchase more bikes compared to non-homeowners.

## âœ… Recommendations  
Based on the insights from the dashboard, the following recommendations are made:

- **Target Married Professionals in North America**: They show the highest interest in purchasing bikes.
- **Leverage Educational Marketing**: Campaigns targeting individuals with Bachelor's or Graduate degrees may yield better results.
- **Offer Homeowner Incentives**: Since homeowners are more likely to purchase, offering home-installation perks or loyalty rewards could be effective.
- **Regional Focus**: Increase ad spend and engagement efforts in North America and Europe for higher conversion.

## ðŸ§¾ Conclusion  
This analysis demonstrates how demographic factors like education, marital status, occupation, and region influence bike purchases. By understanding these patterns, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies and product offerings for better customer engagement and sales performance.
