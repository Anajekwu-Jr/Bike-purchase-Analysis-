Bike Purchase Analysis

Overview

This project analyzes bike purchase trends from a dataset of 1,000 individuals, focusing on key demographic factors like marital status, gender, region, education level, and occupation. The analysis was performed using data visualization techniques, offering insights into purchasing behavior across different segments. The dashboard provides an interactive overview of bike purchases by various factors and is designed to help companies better understand their customers and make informed business decisions.

Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

Marital Status: Whether the individual is married or single.

Gender: The gender of the individual.

Region: Geographical location of the individual (North America, Europe, Pacific).

Occupation: The individual’s occupation (Professional, Skilled Manual, Clerical, etc.).

Education Level: The highest level of education attained (e.g., Bachelor's, Graduate Degree, High School).


Insights & Findings

The analysis led to the following key insights:

1. Marital Status & Gender: Married individuals, especially in North America, tend to buy more bikes. Female buyers in both Europe and North America showed a notable preference for purchasing bikes.


2. Education Level & Gender: Individuals with higher education (Bachelor’s degree and above) were more likely to purchase bikes. Education level was a significant factor, particularly for buyers from professional backgrounds.


3. Region: North America leads in bike purchases, followed by Europe and the Pacific. Regional patterns indicate a strong preference for bike purchases in specific geographical areas.


4. Homeownership: Homeowners were significantly more likely to purchase bikes compared to non-homeowners, suggesting a connection between stability and bike ownership.



Tools & Technologies

Microsoft Power BI: Used for creating the interactive dashboard and visualizing the data.

Excel: Used to clean and preprocess the data before importing it into Power BI.

Data Analytics Techniques: Employed various data analysis methods such as correlation analysis, group comparisons, and trend analysis.
